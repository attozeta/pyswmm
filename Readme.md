Overview
========

A proof-of-concept wrapper for SWMM using Python. Input files are represented by
a (ordered) map from section names to section data where the latter is just a
list of string lists. This makes it possible to refer to different sections by
name and read (write) their data items by list fiddling.

Keep in mind that currently invalid files may be falsely accecpted as a rigorous
approach would require a more detailed (section specific) parser.
